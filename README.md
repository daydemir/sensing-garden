# Guide for setting up the Sensing Garden Monitoring System


Hardware you need to setup this system: 
- RaspberryPi (v.3-5)
- Converter cable for raspberryPi5 if needed
- Camera Module 3 (regular or wide)
- RaspberryPi 27W USB-C Power Supply
- MicroHDMI to HDMI
- Mouse
- Keyboard


## Getting started with RaspberryPi 

Follow the guide to setup your raspberry pi on their official webpage: 

[Official guide on the RaspberryPi Website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html)


TIPS: [RaspberryPi Connect](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#raspberry-pi-connect) to be able to connect to your raspberryPi remotely. 


## Camera Module

*Official documentation for the camera module: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf#page=6.10*

---

As of mid-September 2022, Picamera2 is pre-installed in all Raspberry Pi OS images. You can update it with a full system update, or via the terminal with:

```
sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2
``` 

You can check that libcamera is working by opening a command window and typing:

```python
rpicam-hello
```

You should see a camera preview window for about five seconds. If you do not, please refer to the Raspberry Pi camera documentation.


*Note to self: If you're using picamera2 installed through `apt`, you don't need a virtual environment. Just run your script directly with the system's Python*


### First example

The following script will:
1. Open the camera system
2. Generate a camera configuration suitable for preview
3. Configure the camera system with that preview configuration
4. Start the preview window
5. Start the camera running
6. Wait for two seconds and capture a JPEG file (still in the preview resolution)


GUI users should enter:

```python
from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
import time
picam2 = Picamera2()
camera_config = picam2.create_preview_configuration()
picam2.configure(camera_config)
picam2.start_preview(Preview.QTGL)
picam2.start()
time.sleep(2)
picam2.capture_file("test.jpg")

```


## Ultralytics

*Official guide from Ultralytics platform: https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/raspberry-pi/#install-ultralytics-package*


### Use NCNN on Raspberry Pi

Out of all the model export formats supported by Ultralytics, NCNN delivers the best inference performance when working with Raspberry Pi devices because NCNN is highly optimized for mobile/ embedded platforms (such as ARM architecture). Therefor our recommendation is to use NCNN with Raspberry Pi.

1. **Convert model:** 

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a YOLO11n PyTorch model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Export the model to NCNN format
model.export(format="ncnn")  # creates 'yolo11n_ncnn_model'

# Load the exported NCNN model
ncnn_model = YOLO("yolo11n_ncnn_model")

# Run inference
results = ncnn_model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg") 

```


2. **Use Raspberrypi camera with the model**

There are 2 methods of using the Raspberry Pi Camera to inference YOLO11 models.

**Method 1:**
We can use `picamera2` which comes pre-installed with Raspberry Pi OS to access the camera and inference YOLO11 models.

```python
import cv2
from picamera2 import Picamera2

from ultralytics import YOLO

# Initialize the Picamera2
picam2 = Picamera2()
picam2.preview_configuration.main.size = (1280, 720)
picam2.preview_configuration.main.format = "RGB888"
picam2.preview_configuration.align()
picam2.configure("preview")
picam2.start()

# Load the YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

while True:
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    frame = picam2.capture_array()

    # Run YOLO11 inference on the frame
    results = model(frame)

    # Visualize the results on the frame
    annotated_frame = results[0].plot()

    # Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow("Camera", annotated_frame)

    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord("q"):
        break

# Release resources and close windows
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

```

**Method 2:**
We need to initiate a TCP stream with `rpicam-vid` from the connected camera so that we can use this stream URL as an input when we are inferencing later. Execute the following command to start the TCP stream.

```python
rpicam-vid -n -t 0 --inline --listen -o tcp://127.0.0.1:8888
```

Learn more about `rpicam-vid` usage on [official Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#rpicam-vid).

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a YOLO11n PyTorch model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Run inference
results = model("tcp://127.0.0.1:8888")

```


# Command to remember

```python
sudo apt update # updating raspberrypi - DO THIS ON DEFAULT EVERY TIME YOU INSTALL NEW LIBRARIES
sudo apt upgrade # upgrading raspberrypi
```
